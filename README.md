Hey there! 👋 Welcome to ConceptKitchen - a project born from my curiosity about what happens when AI meets culinary entrepreneurship. 

Ever wondered what it takes to conceptualize a restaurant from scratch? Me too. That's why I built this.

## 🌟 What's This All About?

Picture this: You've always dreamed of opening a restaurant, but you're stuck at square one - the concept. What cuisine? What style? What makes it special? 

ConceptKitchen is my attempt to solve that creative block. It's an AI-powered tool that doesn't just throw random restaurant names at you (though it started that way!). Instead, it aims to be your digital co-founder, helping you build a complete restaurant concept from the ground up.

## ✨ What Can It Do Right Now?

Currently, ConceptKitchen can:
- 🎯 Generate unique restaurant names based on your chosen cuisine
- 📝 Create menu items that actually make sense together
- 🏷️ Suggest taglines and branding ideas
- 🍽️ Adapt to different restaurant styles (casual, fine dining, food truck, etc.)

## 🚀 Where It's Heading

This is very much a work in progress, and I'm excited about what's coming:

- **Comprehensive Business Plans** - Because a restaurant needs more than just a cool name
- **Financial Projections** - Real numbers for real dreamers
- **Market Analysis** - Understanding your competition and target audience
- **Export Everything** - Professional PDFs and spreadsheets you can actually use
- **Supplier Recommendations** - Connect with local vendors
- **Seasonal Menu Planning** - Keep things fresh year-round

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

I chose these tools for good reasons:

- **Streamlit** - Makes it ridiculously easy to create beautiful data apps
- **LangChain** - The backbone for structured AI interactions
- **Groq** - Blazing fast inference with Llama 3.1 (seriously, it's quick!)
- **Python** - Because what else would I use? 😄

## 💻 Want to Run It Locally?

Sure thing! Here's how:

1. **Clone this repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Saipraneet173/ConceptKitchen.git
   cd ConceptKitchen
   ```

2. **Set up your environment** (I recommend using venv)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the requirements**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Get your Groq API key**
   - Head over to [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys)
   - Generate a key (it's free!)
   - Create a `.env` file and add:
     ```
     GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here
     ```

5. **Fire it up!**
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

## 🎯 Why I Built This

As someone diving deep into AI and software development, I wanted to create something that:
1. Actually solves a problem (restaurant planning is HARD)
2. Shows my ability to work with modern AI tools
3. Could potentially help real entrepreneurs
4. Lets me explore the intersection of AI and business

Plus, I love food. So there's that. 🍕

## 🤔 Current Challenges I'm Working On

Being transparent here - there are some things I'm still figuring out:
- Making the financial projections actually accurate (turns out restaurant economics are complex!)
- Balancing creativity with practical business sense
- Keeping the AI responses consistently high quality
- Building a proper database of supplier information

If you have ideas or want to contribute, I'm all ears!

*Built with ☕ and too many late-night debugging sessions by Saipraneet*

**P.S.** - If you actually use this to start a restaurant, I want an invite to the grand opening! 😉
